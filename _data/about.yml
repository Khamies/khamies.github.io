  - label: "Overview"
    value: >
      I am an Applied AI Scientist at NTWIST, where I design AI-powered solutions for scheduling and automation in the manufacturing industry. 
      Alongside my professional work, I pursue graduate research at the University of Alberta to advance my expertise in reinforcement learning and decision-making systems. 
      My focus is on creating practical, trustworthy AI that bridges cutting-edge research with real-world applications.


  - label: "Focus Areas"
    value: >
      I study reinforcement learning and self-supervised methods for complex decision-making problems. In parallel, I apply
      machine learning in industrial settings, particularly for automating manufacturing processes. I aim to balance
      theoretical progress with applied impact so that systems are not only well-designed but also effective in deployment.

  - label: "Background"
    value: >
      I hold a Master’s in Mathematical Sciences (Machine Learning) from the African Masters in Machine Intelligence program
      and a Bachelor’s in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Khartoum. Earlier experiences include
      research at MILA in Montreal and a robotics internship at Brown University, which strengthened my foundations and
      broadened my view of real-world AI challenges.

  - label: "Professional Experience"
    value: >
      At NTWIST, I work full-time as an Applied AI Scientist, designing and implementing machine learning solutions to
      optimize industrial workflows. My focus includes reinforcement learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised
      learning, with an emphasis on systems that adapt to practical environments. This industry work complements my academic
      research and helps connect theory to application.
