description: This a Pytorch implementation of Batch Inverse-Variance Weighting Deep Heteroscedastic Regression, Mai et al 2021.An approach to include privileged information in the loss function of the deep learning models, together with dataset statistics inferred from the mini-batch to mitigate the impact of the dataset misalignment, by adapting the idea of Fisher-information weighted average to function approximation.
