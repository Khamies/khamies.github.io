description: This is a Pytorch implementation of a summarization model that has been fine-tuned on the top of Google-T5 pre-trained model. The implementation uses HuggingFace `transformers` and `datasets` libraries while model has been fine-tuned on two public summarization datasets, Wikihow and Xsum.
