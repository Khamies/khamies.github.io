# About Me

###### Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,  a former research assistant at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/) under the supervision of [Liam Paull](https://liampaull.ca/), where my research focusing on developing deep learning algorithms that suitable in robotics applications scenarios. I received my master at [AMMI](https://aimsammi.org/) in Mathematical sciences/Machine learning, where I worked in interpretability of reinforcement learning framework under the supervision of [George konidaris](http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/), previously I received my bachelor degree at [UofK](https://www.uofk.edu/en) in Electrical and electronics engineering, where I worked under the supervision of [Benjamin Rosman](https://www.benjaminrosman.com/).



> ### My objective is to build and productionize machine learning systems that is capable of working autonomously in applications related to RL and NLP.
