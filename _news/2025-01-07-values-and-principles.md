### Introduction

As I reflect on the journey that has brought me to this point in life, I realized that I need to slow down and have a moment with myself to reflect back on my past decisions, actions, and their outcomes. I needed to pin down things that drive my decisions and define how I see the world around me, as living principled-centered life always requires constant reflections and a commitment to align individual actions with deeply held beliefs. The goal of this essay is to not only communicate my values, and principles that genuinely I stand for and resonate with me, but also to connect with people who share similar beliefs to build a better future for our kids and people we love.

### It's For You First, Then Other People

I believe that individuals who are able to communicate their values have greater clarity in their decisions which leads to better outcomes, even when facing challenges. For example, we have seen many people prefer to lose big monetary rewards in exchange for holding on to their core values, or some who choose to speak the truth even when it has negative consequences for their career or life. The common factor between these individuals is that:

> Living up to their values makes them feel good and balanced spiritually, psychologically, and physically.



Standing on solid values and principles protects you from your future self, specially when things are not going according to your plans. At that time, you may find the solution to your problems is to just give up or take an easy road, which is opposite when you stand on strong value like perseverance which keeps you pushing till the end of the tunnel. In addition, holding on to solid principles protect others from yourself, as you may got into a situation where backstabbing someone could have better short outcomes or bearing false witness would work to your benefits. That's why being clear about your values always will have positive impacts on you before other people.

### The Pillars: Values

Values are the core beliefs that guide someone behavior and decisions. Values comes and shaped by various factors: the community that you live in, your personal goals that you are seeking, the religion that you are practicing, or even during having a deep conversation with your friend. Also, values could be local and subject to the place and time that you're in, and they could be universal and timeless spreading across continents and centuries. Personally, I have picked the most important values that resonates with me and I rely on them in every decision that i make, then I grouped them according to their purpose and impact on my life. These values serve as the foundation for my actions, relationships, and the way I perceive the world.

### Final Note

I want to leave one final note before ending this essay, what I have shared above are the ideals and I always strive to maintain strong and clear values, but in complex situations, compromise between multiple values is often needed, which is an art that gets better over time. Additionally, my principles are not static; they evolve as I gain new insights and experiences, enriching my moral compass. I will leave you with this final quote:

> Wisdom is knowing which values to hold firm and which to bend in the wind.
